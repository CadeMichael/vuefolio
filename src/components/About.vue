                                                <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">- I obtained the <b>Salesforce JavaScript Developer Certification</b>, through self study and experience working with both vanilla JS and the Salesforce Lightning web framework to build out front ends within the salesforce ecosystem. For several projects I was tasked with writing Apex code (a wrapper around Java) to make and process API endpoint calls which were then relayed to a front end.</p>
                                                <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">- I was also responsible for writing tests, both unit tests and test scripts. This built upon my experience from being a test framework engineer at Bluescape and aided in my ability to write clean, maintainable code</p>

If a test needed to be written or updated I documented my code and ran test deployments that when passed would get deployed into production</p>

						<p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">- After working as an undergraduate research assistant and helping researchers analyze experimental data, I decided to switch my career aspiration to CS. I built a PC, started using Linux, and switched all coursework to CS.</p>

I make youtube content on programming and the editors that I am using. I have made several Neovim plugins using Lua for personal use, and one for the Zig programming language that has been starred around 19 times on GitHub (so I hope some people are using it aswell!). Computer Science has become a huge part of my life and my goal is to keep learning and programming daily</p>
